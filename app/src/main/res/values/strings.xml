    <string name="privacy_policy">A number of major, overarching privacy regulations have been made law in the last few years, and they’re
        not restricted to single nations. One of these regulations covers 28 countries, some apply to two or three countries, and one was
        developed by one state (California) but manages to apply to the entire USA.The most significant regulation is the EU’s
        (European Union’s) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect in May of 2018 and quite rigorously secures
        the confidentiality of the personal information of all those in the 28 EU countries. It’s 88 pages long and goes further than any
        other regulation to establish a safe online environment for consumers.Australia’s Privacy Act of 1988 was drafted before
        information technology was a major threat to personal privacy. However, its principles still apply today and the letter of the law
        has been updated to reflect current conditions.</string>
